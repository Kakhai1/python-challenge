repo for data bootcamp wk 3 - Python challenge

This repo contains examples of applications taught by a data science bootcamp demonstrating understanding and applications of python code in accessing and analysing excel csv data. This code is inspired by the information obtained from this bootcamp.

Knowledge and application of dictionaries was further received from the educational website:
www.w3schools.com/python

This knowledge was applied in utilising lists to produce an output in a txt file for the PyPoll project.
